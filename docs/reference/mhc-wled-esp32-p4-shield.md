# MHC-WLED ESP32-P4 shield — hardware reference

Terminal pinout and onboard features for the **MHC-WLED ESP32-P4 shield** (myhome-control), the P4-NANO carrier used on the bench (catalog `deviceModel: "MHC-WLED ESP32-P4 shield"`, `esp32p4rev1-eth` firmware). Read from the board silkscreen + the builder's schematics so projectMM work reads this instead of the marketing render. The shield sits on a **Waveshare ESP32-P4-NANO**; GPIO numbers are the P4's.

> **Board revision:** the terminal map and RS-485 wiring below are transcribed from a **V1** board (the builder's labelled V1 photos + schematics). The overview render is a **V2** render. Whether V2 keeps the identical GPIO↔terminal wiring is **not confirmed here** — treat the map as V1-specific and verify against your own board's silkscreen if you have a different revision.

## Pinout

### GPIO ↔ screw-terminal map (V1 board)

The output/RS-485 terminals, left to right, with the P4 GPIO each carries:

![MHC-WLED ESP32-P4 shield GPIO terminal map](../assets/reference/mhc-wled-esp32-p4-shield-gpio-terminal-map.png)

`O21 O20 O25 O5 O7 O23 O8 O27 O3 O22 O24 O4` — the level-shifted single-ended LED outputs, then the four RS-485 differential pairs.

**Nothing on this shield is a bare GPIO.** Every terminal routes through protection or level-shifting — the reason a direct drive-and-read WS2812 loopback jumper fails on it (see below). Four terminal groups:

### 12x outputs — level-shifted, single-ended (LED data)

The LED-data outputs. Each terminal is `O<gpio>` on the silkscreen; a level shifter drives the 5 V strand from the P4's 3.3 V. The catalog wires the Parallel LED driver (peripheral `Parlio`) to the **first eight terminals in physical order**: `21,20,25,5,7,23,8,27`.

**The first eight terminals are not the eight lowest-numbered outputs.** Positions 5 and 7 carry GPIO **7** and **8**, not 22 and 24. An earlier version of this table listed `O22`/`O24` in those positions and the catalog followed it, so a strip on terminals 5 and 7 stayed dark while GPIO 22/24 emitted on their RS-485 terminals instead (bench 2026-09-08: two panels of eight unlit, fixed by moving lanes 4 and 6 to GPIO 7/8).

| Terminal | GPIO | Note |
|---|---|---|
| O21 O20 O25 O5 O7 O23 O8 O27 | 21 20 25 5 7 23 8 27 | LED lanes (Parallel LED, peripheral `Parlio`, default), in terminal order |
| O7 / O8 | 7 / 8 | ALSO the I²C bus (SDA 7 / SCL 8). Driving them as LED lanes means no I²C on this shield, which is why the catalog entry carries no I2cScan module. Wire those two strands to `O22`/`O24` instead if you need I²C. |
| O3 | 3 | also on RS-485 (`A-3-B`) — see note below |
| O4 | 4 | also on RS-485 (`A-4-B`) — see note below |
| GND | — | ground for the output block |

> **GPIO 3, 4, 22, 24 each appear TWICE** — once here (level-shifted single-ended output, `O<n>`) and once in the RS-485 block (`A-<n>-B`). It's the *same* P4 GPIO fanned out to two output forms: driving the pin lights up **both** its `O<n>` terminal and its `A-<n>-B` transceiver at once. Wire to whichever form you need. GPIO 21/20/25/5/23/27 have **only** the level-shifted path (no RS-485), which is why the LED-driver default uses those + 22/24 for strips and leaves 3/4 free.

### 4x RS-485 — differential A/B pairs (range extender + DMX)

Each channel is `A-<gpio>-B` on the silkscreen: an **RS-485 transceiver** (an SP3485EN-L/TR, not a bare GPIO) driven by that GPIO, with 120 Ω termination, resettable fuses (nSMD010), and TVS protection (CDSOT23-SM712-ES) on the line. **Each channel occupies TWO screw terminals — an `A` and a `B`** (the differential pair), so the 4 channels are 8 terminals total. Channels on **GPIO 4, 22, 24, 3**.

RS-485 is here for two purposes:

- **Range extender** — RS-485's differential pair carries LED data far past what a single-ended 5 V line manages. At the LED end you need an **RS-485 receiver with a 5 V data output** to convert the differential signal back to the WS2812 single-ended waveform.
- **DMX-512 output** — DMX's physical layer *is* RS-485, so these channels double as DMX outputs. Wire an XLR connector to `GND`, `<n>A`, `<n>B`; in DMX nomenclature **A is Data− (Signal−), B is Data+ (Signal+)**.

**Three channels are transmit-only; one (GPIO 3) is switchable.** On the transmit-only channels (GPIO 4, 22, 24) the transceiver's `RE#`/`DE` direction pins are hard-wired to transmit (`DI` in, `RO` disconnected):

![RS-485 transmit-only channel schematic (GPIO 4)](../assets/reference/mhc-wled-esp32-p4-shield-rs485-transmit-schematic.png)

The **GPIO 3 channel adds a mechanical slide switch** (SW5, MSK12C02) that ties the transceiver's `RE#`/`DE` to 3V3 or GND — i.e. it selects **transmit mode** (`DI`, GPIO 3 drives the line) or **receive mode** (`RO`, GPIO 3 reads the line):

![RS-485 GPIO 3 switchable channel schematic](../assets/reference/mhc-wled-esp32-p4-shield-rs485-gpio3-switchable-schematic.png)

| Channel | GPIO | Terminals | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| A-4-B | 4 | A4, B4 | transmit only |
| A-22-B | 22 | A22, B22 | transmit only |
| A-24-B | 24 | A24, B24 | transmit only |
| A-3-B | 3 | A3, B3 | transmit **or** receive (board switch) |

### 4x in/out header

The `O46 O47 O2 O48` header plus power (`GND`, `In5V`, `Out3V3`):

![MHC-WLED ESP32-P4 shield in/out header](../assets/reference/mhc-wled-esp32-p4-shield-inout-header.png)

Inputs are **diode-protected with a ~16 kHz low-pass filter** — designed for robust button-style inputs, not high-speed signals. GPIO 2 and 46 are P4 **boot straps**. This header is *not* usable for a WS2812 loopback (the filter and protection destroy the ~800 kHz waveform).

### Line-In audio (PCM1808 → I²S)

An onboard **PCM1808** ADC captures a line-in signal and outputs I²S to the P4. Catalog `AudioService`: **SCK 32 · WS 26 · SD 33 · MCLK 36** (the P4 is I²S master, so it drives MCLK).

### Ethernet (RMII)

The P4-NANO's RMII PHY: **MDC 31 · MDIO 52 · RST 51 · CLK 50 (external-in) · PHY addr 1**, `ethType` IP101, external clock. (Catalog `NetworkModule`.)

## Loopback self-test on this shield

The loopback self-test drives a WS2812 frame out one pin and reads it back on a jumpered pin — so it needs a signal path from a Tx pin to an Rx pin. The bare-GPIO terminals can't provide it (every one is buffered), but the **GPIO 3 switchable RS-485 channel can**, because its board switch turns GPIO 3 into a data *input*:

- **Set the GPIO 3 board switch to the receive (input) position**, then jumper the RS-485 differential pairs `A4→A3` and `B4→B3` (the wiring the builder shows):

  ![RS-485 loopback wiring: A4→A3, B4→B3, GPIO 3 switch in input position](../assets/reference/mhc-wled-esp32-p4-shield-rs485-loopback-wiring.png)

- The signal path is: **GPIO 4 emits the WS2812 frame → the first RS-485 transceiver drives it as a differential signal on `A4`/`B4` → the second transceiver reads it back → GPIO 3 receives it as a 3.3 V data input.** So the loopback runs **Tx = GPIO 4, Rx = GPIO 3** with the switch in the input position.
- The bare P4-NANO already proves the frame-size fix directly (GPIO 32↔33, PASS at every grid size), so the shield doesn't need to re-prove it — but this RS-485 path is the builder's intended on-shield loopback, distinct from the bare-GPIO jumper the self-test defaults to.
- To verify LED output *on the shield*, the other honest test is to wire a real **WS2812 strip to an `O<n>` output** and watch it light — that exercises the true path (GPIO → level shifter → strip), which is what the shield is built for.

## Cross-reference

Chip-level GPIO constraints (straps, flash/PSRAM) for the P4 are in [gpio-usage.md § ESP32-P4](gpio-usage.md#esp32-p4); this page is the *board* wiring. The catalog entry is [`mooninstaller/deviceModels.json`](../../mooninstaller/deviceModels.json) (`MHC-WLED ESP32-P4 shield`). RS-485 / DMX-512 as a first-class projectMM output is tracked in the [RS-485 / DMX-512 wired-output backlog item](../backlog/backlog-light.md#rs-485-dmx-512-wired-output-future-the-physical-dmx-driver).
