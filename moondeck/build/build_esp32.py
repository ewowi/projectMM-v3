# Components to drop from an Ethernet-only build. ESP-IDF v6.x has no
# CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_ENABLED switch (the symbol is non-settable, forced y on
# WiFi-capable SoCs), so WiFi is removed via EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS instead.
# All consumers of these use *optional* requires, so excluding them links
# cleanly as long as our own code never references esp_wifi (it doesn't —
# the WiFi platform functions are #ifdef-stubbed in the eth-only build).
#
# NOTE: esp_phy is NOT excluded — it provides RF/clock init the ESP32 EMAC
# (Ethernet RMII) depends on. Excluding it leaves Ethernet stuck "started"
# with no link. Only the genuinely WiFi-side components are dropped.
#
# NOTE on the P4 co-processor components (esp_hosted / esp_wifi_remote / eppp_link):
# the `rules: target == esp32p4` gate in main/idf_component.yml pulls them for ANY
# esp32p4 build, including the WiFi-less esp32p4rev1-eth, because manifest rules can't
# see our eth-only flag. EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS does NOT drop them (the component
# manager resolves the managed dependency before the exclude applies). It's a
# *build-time* cost only: the linker dead-strips the unused code, so they add ~0
# bytes of flash to esp32p4rev1-eth (our coprocessorWifi() is the empty stub there, so
# no esp_hosted symbol is referenced — confirmed: their .text size is 0x0 in the
# .map). Left as-is rather than fought; see docs/backlog/.
