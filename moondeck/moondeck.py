# replug); ports don't self-identify. So we build up to three levels of info,
# each degrading gracefully to the one below:
#   1. path  — always (the cu.* / COM* string itself)
#   2. chip  — the ESP32 family (esp32-s3 / -p4 / classic), from the USB
#              descriptor when the board has native USB (Espressif VID 0x303A);
#              otherwise inferred from the registry's stored firmware.
#   3. board — the specific board name (e.g. "MM-LC16"), from a registry match:
#              on native-USB Espressif chips the USB serial number IS the MAC,
#              so we match MAC→device directly; on external UART adapters
#              (CP210x / CH343) the stable per-adapter serial embedded in the
#              port name keys a device's `usbSerial` field.
# None of this resets or opens the board — it reads the USB descriptor the OS
# already enumerated, so it's safe to run on every dropdown refresh.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Espressif chips with *native* USB (no external UART bridge) advertise VID
# 0x303A; the product-descriptor PID names the family. Boards behind a CP210x
# (SiLabs 0x10C4) or CH343 (WCH 0x1A86) UART bridge expose only the adapter, so
# their chip family isn't in USB — it comes from the registry firmware instead.

# JTAG/serial debug unit", so there's nothing to disambiguate with. Map it only to "native-USB
# Espressif, family unknown"; the specific chip comes from a registry match (MAC/usbSerial) or the
