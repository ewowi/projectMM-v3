"""Serve a built firmware binary over HTTP so a board can pull it via OTA.

MoonBase and the app's updater both take a URL and stream it with
`esp_https_ota`, which is the fast path for putting a local build on a board
that is not on USB. What it needs from the other end is HTTP/1.1.

WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS rather than `python -m http.server`: that serves
HTTP/1.0, whose default is no keep-alive and a body that ends when the
connection closes rather than at Content-Length. MoonBase asks for keep-alive
and a 32 KB receive buffer, and against a 1.0 server the transfer crawls and
then fails with `0xffffffff` (ESP_FAIL) partway through. That cost two failed
OTA attempts on a bench board before the `HTTP/1.0` in the response line was
spotted, while the identical URL from GitHub (HTTP/1.1) worked first time.

Serves exactly one file, read fresh per request so a rebuild is picked up
without a restart.

    No packet is sent: connect() on a UDP socket only picks the route, which is

    exist, though, and a bench network with no way out has none, so a failure
    here falls back to the hostname and finally to a placeholder. The address is
    only PRINTED, so getting it wrong must not stop the server binding: an
