// The module picker offers scripts and compiled modules as one list.
//
// To a user, adding `dot` and adding `DemoReel` are the same gesture: one is a MoonLive script and
// the other is compiled, which is a property of the row rather than a category of its own. So the
// picker merges them, sorts them together, and marks the scripted ones. These tests pin the three
// things that make that readable: the marker, the ordering, and the two filter chips.
//
// Read out of app.js rather than imported: the file is a browser script with no module boundary,
// and the alternative (a DOM harness driving the real picker) proved far slower to steer than the
// logic is to check directly.
//
// Run: `node --test test/js`.
