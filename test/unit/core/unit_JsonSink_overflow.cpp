// @module JsonSink

// Pins what happens when a heap-mode sink cannot get the memory it needs.
//
// Both behaviors here were bugs found on the bench (2026-09-08). A classic ESP32 serving a ~40 KB
// state document truncated it at a power of two and shipped it as a COMPLETE WebSocket frame: the
// browser parsed it, threw, and every module card past the cut vanished with nothing logged
// anywhere. Two causes, one per test below.
