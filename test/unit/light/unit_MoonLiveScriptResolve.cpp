// Which FILE a script name means.
//
// A device keeps factory scripts in `/.moonlive`, downloaded by the UI from the shipped catalog,
// and the user's own in `/moonlive`. A name can therefore exist in one, the other, or both, and
// which one wins is what makes editing a factory script a fork rather than a change to it: the
// user's copy shadows the factory one, and deleting that copy restores the original without
// needing a network.
//
// These pin the three cases plus the one that used to be a bug waiting to happen: both readers
// (the compiler and the change-detector) must resolve to the SAME file, or a fork would be
// compiled from one and hashed from the other and recompile on every prepare sweep forever.
